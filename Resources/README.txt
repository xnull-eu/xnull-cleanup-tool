ICON FILE INSTRUCTIONS

To make the application icon appear in the taskbar:

1. Place a valid .ico file named "cleanup.ico" in this directory
2. The icon file should be at least 32x32 pixels in size
3. If you don't have an icon file, you can convert a PNG or JPG to ICO format using online converters or image editing software

Note: The application is already configured to use this icon file, you just need to provide a valid icon.
